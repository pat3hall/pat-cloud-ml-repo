3.17 Reviewing SageMaker's Object Detection Algorithm

  SageMaker's Object Detection algorithm Overview
    - It is a supervised learning algorithm that takes images as input, and identifies all instances of objects
      within the image scene.

    - The object is categorized into one of the classes in a specified collection with a confidence score that
      it belongs to the class.
    - Its location and scale in the image are indicated by a rectangular bounding box

    - It uses the Single Shot multibox Detector (SSD) framework and supports two base networks: VGG and ResNet.

    - Supoorts full training mode and transfer learning mode


  Sagemaker Object Detection algorithm Attributes
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/object-detection.html
    Learning Type:
      - supervised learning algorithm that specializes in classifying and detecting images.

    File/Data Types:
      - recordIO format or image formats (JPG or PNG).
      - Each image also needs a .json file for annotation, and the file name must match the image name.
        - annotations provides object classes and locations for each image

    Instance Type:
      - recommends using GPU instances with more memory for training the images
      - CPU or a GPU can be used in the inference stage.

    Hyperparameters
      https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/object-detection-api-config.html
      required hyperparameters
        num_classes
          - Number of output classes.
          - This parameter defines the dimensions of the network output and is typically set to the number of classes in the dataset.
          - Valid values: positive integer
        num_training_samples
          - Number of training examples in the input dataset.
          - If there is a mismatch between this value and the number of samples in the training set, then the behavior
            of the lr_scheduler_step parameter is undefined and distributed training accuracy might be affected.
          - Valid values: positive integer

    Metrics
      https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/object-detection-tuning.html
        validation:mAP
          - Mean Average Precision (mAP) computed on the validation set.
          - goal: Maximize

  Object Detection Business use cases

    automated checkout system
       - to detect and identify items in a shopping cart at a checkout counter.
    manufacturing quality control
       - to detect defects in the products during the manufacturing process
    finance
      - to detect and verify information in scanned documents like checks, invoices and ID cards.

  Note: Missing:
    Finally, in the resources section, you will see a page containing a sample notebook demonstrating SageMaker's
    object detection algorithm.

    Object Detection Sample Notebooks
      - For a sample notebook that shows how to use the SageMaker AI Object Detection algorithm to train and host
        a model on the Caltech Birds (CUB 200 2011) dataset using the Single Shot multibox Detector algorithm,
