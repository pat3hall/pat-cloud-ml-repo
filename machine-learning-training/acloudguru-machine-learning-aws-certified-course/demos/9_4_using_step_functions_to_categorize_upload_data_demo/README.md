9.4 Using AWS Step Functions to Categorize Uploaded Data


About this lab

  AWS Step Functions is a powerful service that lets you build and orchestrate different AWS services to construct
  state machines. This can be done with almost any AWS API action, and with little-to-no code.

  In this lab, we're going to build a Step Functions state machine to process an MP3 call recording, determine
  the sentiment of the conversation, and take a different action depending on the analysis.

Learning objectives
  - Create the Step Function State Machine
  - Implement Amazon Transcribe to the State Machine
  - Implement Amazon Comprehend to the State Machine
  - Develop a Choice state based on Sentiment

Solution
Log in to the Lab Environment

    To avoid issues with the lab, open a new Incognito or Private browser window to log in to the lab. This ensures that your personal account credentials, which may be active in your main window, are not used for the lab.
    Log in to the AWS Management Console using the credentials provided on the lab instructions page. Make sure you're using the us-east-1 region.

Create a Step Functions State Machine

    In the search bar on top, type "Step Functions" to search for the Amazon Kinesis service.
    Click on the Step Functions result to go directly to the Step Functions service.
    Click on the State machines button in the sidebar.
    Click on the Create state machine button to launch the wizard to create the state machine.
    When prompted to select a template, opt for a blank state machine.
    Navigate to the Config section of the state machine.
    Update the Execution role to the pre-created step-function-execution-role, which will provide the necessary permissions for the lab.

    Navigate to the Design section of the state machine.

    Add a Choice flow state after the Check Transcription Job state.

    Set the conditions for the first Choice state rule to the following condition:
        Variable: $.TranscriptionJob.TranscriptionJobStatus
        Operator: is equal to
        Value: String constant
        COMPLETED

    Add the comment Transcript Completed to the first rule.

    Create a second rule for the Choice state.

    Set the conditions for the first Choice state rule to the following condition:
        Variable: $.TranscriptionJob.TranscriptionJobStatus
        Operator: is equal to
        Value: String constant
        IN_PROGRESS

    Add the comment Transcript Processing to the first rule.

    Add a Wait flow state between the Start Call Transcription Job state, and the Check Transcription Job state.

    Set the wait timer to a fixed interval of 2 seconds.

    Rename the state name to Wait 2 seconds.

    Return to the Choice state.

    Update the next state for the second rule (In Progress) to Wait 2 seconds to create a loop.
