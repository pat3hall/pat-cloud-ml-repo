  Deploy Model into Production
    - Mr K has give us the go to deploy the optimized Linear Learner model in production
    - Once this ic complete, Mr K's team can use it to investigate any newly reported UFO sightings

    - our goal is deploy the model into production and give Mr K's team some way to interact with the deployed model

  Deploy Model into Production
    - deploy our Linear Learner model using SageMaker hosting
    - create a way to interact with the SageMaker endpoint created for the deployed model
    - How will Mr K's team interact with the model? Will there be some type of user interface?
    - What does the input and output of a request look like? Will it be in batches of immediate response?

  Final Results
    - Make a request to the SageMaker hosted model
        {
         "data": "45.0, 10.0,38.5816667,-121.49333329999999,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0"
        }
          Note: input data had to be transformed to numeric format for the Linear learner model
    - view the output response from the trained model:
          Explained, Unexplained, or Probable

  Deploy to SageMaker Hosting
    - Simply call the deploy() method after training our model to deploy it to SageMaker hosting

    Notes:
        - reason I suggest using the .deploy method() is because when we use it within a Jupyter notebook, it makes
          it really easy and only one line of code to deploy our model.
        - if you're using the user interface, you could simply point it to the model artifact that you already trained,
          or you could point it to a training job that you had pre created.

  Create Lambda and API GateWay Endpoint
    - Create an API Gateway endpoint that invokes a Lambda function
    - This Lambda function calls '.invoke_endpoint()' method with an new UFO sightings (calls the sagemaker trained model)
    - return the results from the models prediction

   SageMaker Hosting, Lambda, API Gateway
      - create a new Jupyter notebook and retrain our model.
      - when retraining our model, so we can hold out a portion of our data set to test it once we deploy our model.
      - after retraining, going to then deploy it to a SageMaker model endpoint and then use our test data set to test
        against that newly created endpoint
      -  Next, create a Lambda function which calls the .invoke_endpoint() method and sends a request of a new UFO sighting.
      - Once we have our Lambda function set up, we can then create an API Gateway endpoint, which creates an HTTP endpoint
        that we can call from API Gateway, or we can call it from any other application.

                                                                        |----------------------------------|

             Step 2: Cleaning, transforming and preparing the dataset

             This step is so important. It's crucial that we clean and prepare our data before we do anything else.

             Let's go ahead and start preparing our dataset by transforming some of the values into the correct data types.
             Here is what we are going to take care of.

              1. Convert the reportedTimestamp and eventDate to a datetime data types.
              2. Convert the shape and weather to a category data type.
              3. Map the physicalEvidence and contact from 'Y', 'N' to 0, 1.
              4. Convert the researchOutcome to a category data type (target attribute).

             Let's also drop the columns that are not important.

              1. We can drop sighting becuase it is always 'Y' or Yes.
              2. Let's drop the firstName and lastName becuase they are not important in determining the researchOutcome.
              3. Let's drop the reportedTimestamp becuase when the sighting was reporting isn't going to help us determine
                 the legitimacy of the sighting.
              4. We would need to create some sort of buckets for the eventDate and eventTime, like seasons for example, but
                 since the distribution of dates is pretty even, let's go ahead and drop them.

             Finally, let's apply one-hot encoding

              1. We need to one-hot both the weather attribute and the shape attribute.
              2. We also need to transform or map the researchOutcome (target) attribute into numeric values. This is what the
                alogrithm is expecting. We can do this by mapping unexplained, explained, and probable to 0, 1, 2.


         >>> # Replace the missing values with the most common shape (circle)
         >>> df['shape'] = df['shape'].fillna(df['shape'].value_counts().index[0])
         >>>
         >>> # Convert the reportedTimestamp and eventDate to a datetime data types.
         >>> df['reportedTimestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['reportedTimestamp'])
         >>> df['eventDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['eventDate'])
         >>>
         >>> # Convert the shape and weather to a category data type.
         >>> df['shape'] = df['shape'].astype('category')
         >>> df['weather'] = df['weather'].astype('category')
         >>>
         >>> # Map the physicalEvidence and contact from 'Y', 'N' to 0, 1
         >>> df['physicalEvidence'] = df['physicalEvidence'].replace({'Y': 1, 'N': 0})
         >>> df['contact'] = df['contact'].replace({'Y': 1, 'N': 0})
         >>>
         >>> # Convert the researchOutcome to a category data type (target attribute).

         >>> # Let's one-hot the weather and shape attribute

         >>> df['researchOutcome'] = df['researchOutcome'].replace({'unexplained': 0, 'explained': 1, 'probable': 2})

             5 rows Ã 23 columns

             (18000, 23)


             Step 3: Creating and training our model (Linear Learner)

             Let's evaluate the Linear Learner algorithm as well. Let's go ahead and randomize the data again and get it ready
             for the Linear Leaner algorithm. We will also rearrange the columns so it is ready for the algorithm (it expects
             the first column to be the target attribute)


         >>> # random and split data (80% train, 10% valication, 10% test)
         >>> np.random.seed(0)
         >>> rand_split = np.random.rand(len(df))
         >>> train_list = rand_split < 0.8
         >>> val_list = (rand_split >= 0.8) & (rand_split < 0.9)
         >>> test_list = rand_split >= 0.9
         >>>
         >>>  # This dataset will be used to train the model.
         >>> data_train = df[train_list]
         >>>
         >>> # This dataset will be used to validate the model.
         >>> data_val = df[val_list]
         >>>
         >>> # This dataset will be used to test the model.
         >>> data_test = df[test_list]
         >>>
         >>> # Breaks the datasets into attribute numpy.ndarray and the same for target attribute.
         >>> train_X = data_train.drop(columns='researchOutcome').values
         >>> train_y = data_train['researchOutcome'].values
         >>>
         >>> val_X = data_val.drop(columns='researchOutcome').values
         >>> val_y = data_val['researchOutcome'].values
         >>>
         >>> test_X = data_test.drop(columns='researchOutcome').values
         >>> test_y = data_test['researchOutcome'].values

             Next, Let's create recordIO file for the training data and upload it to S3.


         >>> train_file = 'ufo_sightings_train_recordIO_protobuf.data'
         >>>
         >>> # converts the data in numpy array format to RecordIO format (using SageMaker common library)
         >>> f = io.BytesIO()
         >>> smac.write_numpy_to_dense_tensor(f, train_X.astype('float32'), train_y.astype('float32'))
         >>> f.seek(0)
         >>>
         >>> boto3.Session().resource('s3').Bucket(bucket).Object('implementation_operations_lab/linearlearner_train/{}'.format(train_file)).upload_fileobj(f)
         >>> training_recordIO_protobuf_location = 's3://{}/implementation_operations_lab/linearlearner_train/{}'.format(bucket, train_file)
         >>> print('The Pipe mode recordIO protobuf training data: {}'.format(training_recordIO_protobuf_location))
             The Pipe mode recordIO protobuf training data: s3://modeling-ufo-lab1/implementation_operations_lab/linearlearner_train/ufo_sightings_train_recordIO_protobuf.data

             Let's create recordIO file for the validation data and upload it to S3

         >>> validation_file = 'ufo_sightings_validatioin_recordIO_protobuf.data'
         >>>
         >>> f = io.BytesIO()
         >>> smac.write_numpy_to_dense_tensor(f, val_X.astype('float32'), val_y.astype('float32'))
         >>> f.seek(0)
         >>>
         >>> boto3.Session().resource('s3').Bucket(bucket).Object('implementation_operations_lab/linearlearner_validation/{}'.format(validation_file)).upload_fileobj(f)
         >>> validate_recordIO_protobuf_location = 's3://{}/implementation_operations_lab/linearlearner_validation/{}'.format(bucket, validation_file)
         >>> print('The Pipe mode recordIO protobuf validation data: {}'.format(validate_recordIO_protobuf_location))
             The Pipe mode recordIO protobuf validation data: s3://modeling-ufo-lab1/implementation_operations_lab/linearlearner_validation/ufo_sightings_validatioin_recordIO_protobuf.data


             Alright we are good to go for the Linear Learner algorithm. Let's get everything we need from the ECR repository to call the Linear Learner algorithm.


         >>> from sagemaker import image_uris
         >>> container = image_uris.retrieve('linear-learner', boto3.Session().region_name, '1')

         >>> # Create a training job name
         >>> job_name = 'ufo-linear-learner-job-{}'.format(datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S"))
         >>> print('Here is the job name {}'.format(job_name))
         >>>
         >>> # Here is where the model-artifact will be stored
         >>> output_location = 's3://{}/implementation_operations_lab/linearlearner_output'.format(bucket)
             Here is the job name ufo-linear-learner-job-20240717192831


             Next we start building out our model by using the SageMaker Python SDK and passing in everything that is required to create
               a Linear Learner model.

             First I like to always create a specific job name. Next, we'll need to specify training parameters.

             Finally, after everything is included and ready, then we can call the .fit() function which specifies the S3 location for
               training and validation data.

         >>> print('The feature_dim hyperparameter needs to be set to {}.'.format(data_train.shape[1] - 1))
             The feature_dim hyperparameter needs to be set to 22.

         >>> sess = sagemaker.Session()
         >>>
         >>> # Setup the LinearLeaner algorithm from the ECR container
         >>> linear = sagemaker.estimator.Estimator(container,
         >>>                                        role,

             Step 4: Deploying the model into SageMaker hosting

             Next, let's deploy the model into SageMaker hosting onto a single m4 instance. We can then use this instance to test the model with the
               test data that we help out at the beginning of the notebook. We can then evaluate things like accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score.

             We can use some fancy libraries to build out a confusion matrix/heatmap to see how accurate our model is.


         NOTE: linear.deploy() method does
                - spins up the specified type and number the instances (e.g. 1 ml.m4.xlarge instance) that our model is going to be deployed to,
                - creates the endpoint configuration
                - creates an endpoint for us on SageMaker hosting,


         >>> multiclass_predictor = linear.deploy(initial_instance_count=1, instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge')

            This next code is just setup code to allow us to draw out nice and pretty confusion matrix/heatmap.
